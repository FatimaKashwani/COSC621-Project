# COSC621-Project

Each .ipynb file contains a different version of the code, as follows:

Age_estimation: uses all five age groups. Loss is categorical cross-entropy. Metric is accuracy.

Age_estimation_weighted: uses all five age groups. Loss is weighted cross-entropy. Metric is accuracy.

Age_estimation_no_kids: uses 4 age groups (excludes under15). Loss is weighted cross-entropy. Metric is accuracy.

Age_estimation_rmse: uses all five age groups. Loss is weighted cross-entropy. Metric is RMSE.

Age_estimation_no_kids_rmse: uses 4 age groups (excludes under15). Loss is weighted cross-entropy. Metric is RMSE.



# The code does not use the full path for the data files. To run, the .ipynb file being used must be inside the PETA folder.

# Packages: Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy
